                    <p>I am an aspiring Full-stack Developer, looking to acquire professional skills and being upto-date with the futuristic technologies. 
                    I often write <a href="https://prakhar10-blog.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tech Blogs</a> to help people learn, that I have, until now. Also, I like to document my Journey as I gain more knowledge and build new stuff using new technologies.
                    <br /><br />
                    I started off by learning Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. To Test my skills, I practiced Competitive Coding on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/prakhar_10_vars1?hr_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HackerRank</a>, where I earned Gold ‚≠ê Badges in Python and Problem Solving.
                    <br /><br />
                    From there I started onto the path of Web-Development, where I learned much joining <a href="https://neog.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Neog-Camp</a>, under the guidance of Tanay Pratap.
